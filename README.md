# 121final
This is a very minimal way to meet the requirements of this assignment.
I simply took the First Person template from unity, and used the event system 
from the link below along with the "MEGA Fantasy Pack" from the unity asset store.
It is not pretty but I hope this satisfies the base requirements.
Collect(collide with) the scrolls, anvil, spices, barrel, and vase to have the 
night turn to day.
I have the 
5 imported objects above, a cauldron that emits particles,and  a controllable character (20pts)
The player has the only light, which is a flickering flashlight (20pts)
The 5 "clues" are in the game, which are the items mentioned above(20pts);
Colliding with the 5 clues turns the night to day. (20pts)  
# There is no built in quiting, you will have to alt + f4 or cmd +q
